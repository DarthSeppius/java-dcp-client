# Couchbase Java DCP Client
This repository contains a pure java-based implementation for a Couchbase
DCP (Database Change Protocol) client. It is currently a work in progress
and intended to be the primary DCP client going forward, eventually 
deprecating the experimental supported inside `core-io`.
